## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This portfolio is crafted with a focus on creating an immersive experience that resonates with both the content and the user. The design embraces a minimalist and modern aesthetic, utilising ample white space and a cohesive colour scheme to guide the user's attention seamlessly through each section. The interplay between light and dark modes ensures that the visual experience remains sharp and engaging, regardless of the browsing environment.

The interactive elements, including dynamic transitions, scrolling effects, and hover animations, are thoughtfully integrated to enhance the storytelling aspect of the portfolio. This design approach aims to strike a balance between simplicity and sophistication, making the user journey both intuitive and memorable. Whether you're exploring on a large desktop screen or a compact mobile device, the design adapts fluidly to provide an equally compelling experience.

In essence, the design philosophy behind this portfolio is to create a space where content and creativity intersect, allowing the user's experience to feel as seamless and engaging as the technologies showcased within.

## 🌐 Multilingual Support

Switch between languages using the elegant, animated language switcher at the top of the page. The switcher is designed to highlight the selected language, providing a smooth and visually pleasing transition.

## 📜 Features

### 🏆 Dynamic Landing Page

The landing page of my portfolio immediately draws you in with a sleek and minimalist design. It features a centred card with my name, title, and contact details, all set against a calming background. The card itself is interactive—moving dynamically based on the user's mouse pointer, adding a subtle 3D effect that enhances the immersive experience. Additionally, when you hover over the text, it pops up briefly in 3D, creating a lively and engaging visual interaction.

The language switcher at the top left adds a subtle yet functional touch, allowing you to explore the portfolio in English, Korean, or Japanese.

### 🎨 Interactive Name and Background

As you scroll down, you're greeted by a bold and dynamic introduction. My name, "JAMIE SHIN," stands out prominently, surrounded by a cascading text effect that adds depth and movement to the design. The interactive elements are designed to create a lasting first impression.

### 📖 Personal Storytelling

The "About Me" section provides a visually engaging timeline of my life and career milestones. Each event is accompanied by an image and a brief description, presented in a clear and chronological order. The design is both personal and professional, giving visitors a glimpse into my journey.

### 💼 Project Showcase

My portfolio includes a project showcase that highlights my work with clean and organised layouts. The featured project is displayed with detailed descriptions, including the technologies used, links to the live site, and the GitHub repository. The circular design and scrolling effects make the project section both functional and visually appealing.

### 🎥 Personal Footage Integration

One of the unique features of my portfolio is the inclusion of personal footage of my wife and me recorded during our travels. This video adds a personal touch to the portfolio, providing a glimpse into our adventures and highlighting the importance of experiences and relationships in my life. The footage is seamlessly integrated into the design, enhancing the storytelling aspect of the portfolio.
